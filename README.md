A OrangePi zero shield/expand board specially designed for 3D printer with klipper firmware

Due to current chipset shortage sitatuion, raspberry pi price increase to a unreasonable level. 
Hence I'm using OrangePi Zero as a good alternative. A 512MB ram version with 20 dollars price meets all the requirments that klipper host, its performance match eveything that required by klipper 

Key features:
- A dedicate ADXL345 port from SPI1 
- A dedicate MAX31865 port from gpio ports
- Two USB port from orange pi function pin
- A UART port for communicate with MCU board
- A step down buck converter for convert 9~24v DC input to 5v DC
- Three channel pwm output, voltage depends on input DC voltage
- Two channel 5v output
- A build in 3010 chip cooling fan position
